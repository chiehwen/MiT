This is a new open source project (2012.12.12~) for malware behavioral analysis which named MiT and focus as follow:

(1.) We have applying Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Ontology  model for malware behavioral Identify.
(2.) We have Developed a Cluster Hybrid Architecture by Virtual and Physical Structure.
(3.) We will release a free Cloud Drive for share malicious sample and analyze report.
(4.) We also have published many papers on many IEEE Conferences.

The Developer who would like to thanks National University of Tainan in Taiwan and National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan for their kindly supporting this Open Source Research Project. In addition, the Developer also thanks the National Science Council in Taiwan for financially supporting under the Grant NSC99-2911-I-024-004. Finally, MiT is Developed and Copyrighted by TonTon Hsien-De Huang.
